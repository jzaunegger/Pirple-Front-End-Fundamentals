    <h1>Buffalo Chicken Dip Recipe</h1>
    <p>
        Buffalo Chicken Dip is a simple, easy to make recipe that is very popular for parties, or just 
        good for a nice snack. It is cheesy, creamy, and a little spicey. However, how spicey it is, is up 
        to you. Add more Hot Sauce for an extra kick. I really like this dish, because it is very tasty and easy
        to make if you need a quick meal.
